# Namespace: Provides isolation and organization for Kubernetes resources
#
# Think of a namespace as a virtual cluster within your physical cluster.
# It's like having separate folders to organize your files - each namespace
# keeps resources isolated from other namespaces.
#
# Why use namespaces?
# - Separate environments (dev, staging, production)
# - Isolate teams or projects on shared clusters
# - Apply different resource quotas and policies per namespace
# - Avoid naming conflicts between resources

metadata:
  name: go-demo             # Name of the namespace - all our resources will go here
  labels:                   # Labels are key-value pairs for organizing and selecting resources
    name: go-demo           # Label matching the namespace name (convention)
    purpose: learning       # Custom label indicating this is for learning
    app: go-demo            # Application identifier - useful for queries and monitoring
